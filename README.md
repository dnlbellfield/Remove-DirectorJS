# Remove-DirectorJS
Remove DirectorJS
Way back in the "Reading" series, we examined a todo list written with jQuery, Handlebars, and director.js. The app used director.js to modify the URL.

Your job is to rewrite the application so that it doesn't use director.js at all. Instead, use what we learned about window.location.hash to get the job done.

When you're done, the app should work exactly the same way as it did before, except it shouldn't use director.js at all.
Make sure to remove the director.js script tag in index.html.
Make sure the browser's back button works too!
